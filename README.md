# Tenfinity - My C++ Console Projects
This is a collection of small C++ programs showcasing my skills. These were originally university projects, some written in C and later rewritten in C++. Built with Code::Blocks.
## Projects Included
Here are some beginner to intermediate project ideas in C to include in your portfolio:

### 1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**  
   - A two-player or computer-vs-player game with a clean console interface.
### 2. **...**
### **More to come...**

## How to Compile
Using Code::Blocks
1. Open the `.cbp` file in Code::Blocks.
2. Click **Build and Run**.

Note: If you don't have Code::Blocks, you can use your preferred IDE and ignore the .cbp file. Make sure to configure your IDE to include all necessary .cpp files for compilation.  

## Status
This project is a work in progress.
